# MNIST-Neural-Network-Keras
Simple and small version of a neural network, programmed with keras. 


What is MNIST?

What is keras?

How to programm a NN with keras?

Where to get the MNIST files as download ready csv files?
https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/

or if you want to work with the original files on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, you can use my converter (in Java):
https://github.com/TheBuccaneer/EMNIST-Data-TO-CSV-Converter

What else do I need?
numpy, matplotlib and pandas. I recommend "Anaconda" (https://www.anaconda.com/) which has anything you need. 

How to use the software?
1. Create instance of MINST_NN with the two MNIST train- and test-/files-paths as arguments (if you downloaded it from pjreddie.com the arguments would be "PATH\mnist_train.csv" and "PATH\mnist_test.csv")
2. invoke start method
3. adjust program code
