# MNIST-Neural-Network-Keras
Simple and small version of a neural network, programmed with keras. 


What is MNIST?

What is keras?

Where to get the MNIST files as download ready csv files?
https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/

What else do I need?
numpy, matplotlib and pandas. I recommend "Anaconda" (https://www.anaconda.com/) which has anything you need. 

or if you want to work with the original files on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, you can use my converter (in Java):
https://github.com/TheBuccaneer/EMNIST-Data-TO-CSV-Converter

How to use the software?
1. Create instance of MINST_NN with the two MNIST train- and test-/files-path as arguments (if you downloaded it from pjreddie.com the file names are "mnist_train.csv" and "mnist_test.csv")
2. invoke start method
3. adjust program code if you don't need anything
